#  Mutational Distance and Diversity

Requires `mutational_distance_and_diversity_data.zip` from https://evcouplings.org/3Dseq

1. `Mutational Distance and Diversity.ipynb`
   This script calculates and plots (1) the mutational distance from each experimentally
   evolved PSE1 and AAC6 sequence set and (2) the pairwise sequence differences between 
   random sets of sequences in each sequence set.
